# Smart-Desk

Smart-Desk is an on-going personal project which adds intelligence to my standing desk. 

- v1 has granted the desk its own schedule ([post](http://kehang.github.io/iot/2022/11/25/a-desk-with-its-own-schedule/), [demo](https://youtu.be/lJAUM3Wqgdk))
- v2 (current version) has enabled voice-control ([post](http://kehang.github.io/iot/2022/12/26/a-desk-that-listens/), [demo](https://youtu.be/2v-3ZvoLdjo))
